wmconfig is a free tool for automatically generating menus for various
X window managers. It uses a very simple configuration, it's fast and small.
A special toolkit (Gtk or Qt / KDE) is not required and the menu entries may
be edited with the text editor of your choice.

wmconfig will read the application template files located in /etc/wmconfig
and add an entry into the menu if that application is found on your system.
It will also read the application template files from the .wmconfig directory
in the user's home directory.  Therefore, the user's settings will override
the system-wide settings. If optionally any extra files are given as an
argument on the command line, those will be read last and merged with the
others (possibly overriding the settings in system and user home dir files).

wmconfig creates menus for the following window managers/desktop environments:
aewm, afterstep, amiwm, blackbox, ctwm, e16, e17, ede, epiwm, equinox,
fluxbox, flwm, freedesktop, fvwm, fvwm2, fvwm95, gnome2, golem, icewm,
kahakai, kde1, kde2, kde3, kde4, launcher, lxde, mlvwm, mwm, olwm, openbox,
pekwm, piewm, pwm, qvwm, sapphire, tvtwm, twm, ude, vtwm, wmaker, wmx, xfce
