The Zero Install Injector

A running process is created by combining many different libraries
(and other components). In the Zero Install world, we have
all versions of each library available at all times. The problem is
then how to choose which versions to use.

The injector solves this problem by selecting components to meet
a program's requirements, according to a policy you give it.
The injector finds out which versions are available, and downloads 
and runs the ones you choose.
