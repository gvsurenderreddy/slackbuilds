sakura is a terminal emulator based on GTK and VTE. It's a terminal emulator
with few dependencies, so you don't need a full GNOME desktop installed to
have a decent terminal emulator. Sakura uses a notebook to provide several
terminals in one window and adds a contextual menu with some basic options.
