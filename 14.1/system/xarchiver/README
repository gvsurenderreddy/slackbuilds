Xarchiver is a Desktop Environment independent archiver frontend.
All common archive types are supported. RPM and DEB packages are
handled without their package managers. To run it you only need
GTK+2 libraries and obviously the various rar, arj and 7z for
these archive types.

If you want to try an experimental patch to support xz, then run 
the script like this:  BEND_ME_OVER=kthxbai ./xarchiver.SlackBuild
