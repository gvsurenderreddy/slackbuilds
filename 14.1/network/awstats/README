AWStats is a free, powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web
streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically.  AWStats works as a
CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log
contains, in few graphical web pages.  It can analyze log files from all
major server tools like Apache log files and a lot of other web, proxy,
wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.

There's an automated script (awstats_configure.pl) to prepare the httpd
config file located in DOCROOT/awstats/tools/ - however, you should not
need/want to run it; instead, everything should work well if you make the 
changes listed below.

Edit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf (this is a required change to use AWStats):
Comment this out:     CustomLog "/var/log/httpd/access_log" common
Uncomment this:       CustomLog "/var/log/httpd/access_log" combined

Short How-to for using AWStats as CGI:

Add the following include line /etc/httpd/httpd.conf:
Include /etc/httpd/extra/httpd-awstats.conf

Then restart httpd:   "/etc/rc.d/rc.httpd restart"

A sample config file will be placed in /etc/awstats; please read it and
make the necessary changes for your system.  To run awstats, please refer 
to the documentation in the package.
