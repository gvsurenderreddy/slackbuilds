Privoxy is a web proxy  with advanced filtering capabilities for 
protecting privacy, modifying web page data, managing cookies, 
controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other 
obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a very flexible configuration 
and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. 
Privoxy has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user 
networks.

Before executing the script, you will need to create 
a privoxy user and group.  To do that, run the following commands:

groupadd -g 206 privoxy
useradd -u 206 -g 206 -c "Web Proxy" -d /dev/null -s /bin/false privoxy

See README.SLACKWARE for setup information.
