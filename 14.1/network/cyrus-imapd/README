The Cyrus IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server provides access to
personal mail and system-wide bulletin boards through the IMAP protocol.
The Cyrus IMAP server is a scalable enterprise mail system designed for use
from small to large enterprise environments using standards-based
technologies.

A full Cyrus IMAP implementation allows a seamless mail and bulletin board
environment to be set up across multiple servers. It differs from other IMAP
server implementations in that it is run on "sealed" servers, where users
are not normally permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts
of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access
to mail is through software using the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the server large advantages in
efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple concurrent
read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox
hierarchies.

Cyrus is a highly scalable enterprise mail system designed for use in
enterprise environments of various sizes using standards based technologies.
Cyrus technologies scale from independent use in email departments to a system
centrally managed in a large enterprise.

For more information on how to install and run cyrus-imapd, see
README.SLACKWARE that came with this package (which is also installed 
with the documentation).

Two additional patches have been included, autocreate and autosieve, which
improve cyrus' capabilities. To learn more about them, check their accompanying
README files. To disable them, use: PATCHES=no ./cyrus-imapd.SlackBuild

You must have a "cyrus" user and group to run this script.
Something like this will create them:
  # groupadd -g 238 cyrus
  # useradd -d /var/imap -s /bin/sh -u 238 -g 238 cyrus
