rss2email is a free tool for delivering news from RSS feeds to your
email program.  This allows you to view RSS feeds in an interface you
are already familiar with and to apply filters to incoming feeds.

After installing this package, edit /etc/r2e/config.py to taste, then do
the following:

	mkdir ~/.rss2email
	r2e new you@yourdomain.com
	r2e add http://yourfeed.yourdomain.com
	r2e run --no-send

You will probably want to create a cron job to periodically 
execute "r2e run".
