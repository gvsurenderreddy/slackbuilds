MLDonkey is an open source, free software multi-network peer-to-peer app.

This requires ocaml to build and optionally lablgtk2 (if you want to
enable the GUI).  It will try to download lablgtk2 and ocaml from the
web and build them locally if they are not found on your system, so it's
better to make sure that they are already installed.

By default, this SlackBuild will build MLdonkey without a GUI. Without a
GUI, you can control mldonkey by connecting to localhost:4080 with your
web browser.

If you want to build MLDonkey's GUI, you'll have to enable it with the
GUIOPT variable like this: GUIOPT=yes ./mldonkey.SlackBuild
