RipIT is used to create MPEG-1 Layer 3 (mp3) using Lame, or uses Flac (flac),
Ogg Vorbis (ogg), Faac (m4a), Musepack (mpc), mp4als (als), Wavpack (wv) or
ffmpeg to convert audio files (wav) extracted from an audio CD.
It is a console based front-end (no GUI here), written in Perl, for these
programs (which must be installed -- at least one out of each category):

* dagrab, cdparanoia or cdda2wav (tosha and cdd are also supported)
for ripping the audio CD tracks
* Lame, OggVorbis, Flac or Faac, Musepack, mp4als, Wavpack or ffmpeg for
encoding the wav files to a compressed format

Optionally, ripit can use:

* CDDB_get 2.27 or higher, a Perl module for CDDB retrieval
* LWP::simple, a Perl module to access web pages and eventually Digest::MD5
and Unicode::UCD depending your choice of options

When using Musicbrainz DB one needs additionally: WebService::MusicBrainz
and the discid-tool or MusicBrainz::DiscID.

The program will do the following without user intervention:

* get the audio CD Album/Artist/Tracks information from MusicBrainz or freeCDDB
* rip the audio CD Tracks
* encode to Flac, mp3, Ogg-Vorbis, mpc, m4a or als
* id3 tag encoded songs
* create a playlist (m3u) file
* optionally generate a toc or inf files for DAO burning with, CD-text
* optionally prepare and send a CDDB submission and save it locally
* optionally extract hidden songs and split ghost songs
* optionally create md5sum files for all tracks
* run several encoder processes at the same time and same run
