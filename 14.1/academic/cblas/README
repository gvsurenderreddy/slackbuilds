CBLAS is a collection of wrappers that provide a C interface to the FORTRAN
BLAS library.  The interface can be consulted by opening /usr/include/cblas.h

An existing FORTRAN BLAS library must be installed if you intend to build this
package. The reference BLAS from netlib is available at SlackBuilds.org.
