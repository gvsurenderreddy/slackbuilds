eAccelerator is a free open source PHP accelerator and optimizer.  
It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in compiled 
state, so the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated.  
It also optimizes the scripts to speed up execution.

eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of
your PHP code by 1-10 times.
