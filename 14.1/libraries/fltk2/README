The Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK", pronounced "fulltick") is a LGPL'd C++
graphical user interface toolkit for X (UNIX(r)), OpenGL(r), and
Microsoft(r) Windows(r).  It was originally developed by Mr. Bill Spitzak
and is currently maintained by a small group of developers across the world
with a central repository in the US.

The build script is for the development branch (version 2.0.x), thus it is
named "fltk2" to distinguish from the stable one ("fltk") available at
SlackBuilds.org.  Notice that fltk2 does not overwrite any files of fltk.
Thus, it is possible to have both of them in the system if desired.
