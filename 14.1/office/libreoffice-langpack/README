To build other locales, download your language pack from:

  # LOLANG=xx-YY ./libreoffice-langpack.SlackBuild

This package was prepared for LibreOffice built from here at
SlackBuilds.org. if you want to build a package compatible with LibreOffice
built from source (like AlienBOB's packages), start the script as follows:

  # LOLANG=xx-YY ALIEN=yes ./libreoffice-langpack.SlackBuild
