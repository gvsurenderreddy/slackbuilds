id3 mass tagger is a tool for manipulating ID3 and ID3v2 tags in
multiple files. It can generate tag fields from the filename and other
variables, and/or rename files, using an intuitive syntax.

id3 currently supports the old-style ID3 format with track-number
extension (ID3 v1.1), as well as the more complicated ID3v2 (ID3 v2.2.0,
v2.3.0) format.
