Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg
streaming including the vorbis and theora codecs. Also icecast can
handle other streams like MP3/AAC/NSV.
It can be used to create an Internet radio station or a privately
running jukebox and many things in between. It is very versatile in
that new formats can be added relatively easily and supports open
standards for communication and interaction.

Icecast has an optional requirement of speex.
