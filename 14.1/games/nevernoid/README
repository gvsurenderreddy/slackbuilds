nevernoid - clone of the game "Arkanoid", with extra powerups.

Nevernoid is distributed as binary-only freeware; this SlackBuild
script simply packages the binary in a Slack-friendly way, including
a wrapper script to allow the game to work without being run from its
data directory.

Note: the fullscreen option is visible in the options menu, but it's
non-functional (author disabled it on purpose).

Note: the download site checks the HTTP referrer header, wget won't work
without some hackery. Easier to just use a browser.

Note to 64-bit users: The game is a 32-bit x86 binary. It should run if
you have multilib and 32-bit compatibility libraries installed.
