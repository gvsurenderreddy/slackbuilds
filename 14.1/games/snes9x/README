Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES
and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation. The
games include some real gems that were only ever released in Japan.

This SlackBuild works on both 32-bit and 64-bit Slackware systems,
and builds the GTK+ port of snes9x. This SlackBuild was formerly known
as "snes9x_gtk", but has been renamed to plain "snes9x" because the
(formerly unoffocial) GTK+ port has been integrated into the official
snes9x codebase. If you have the old snes9x_gtk package installed,
remove it before installing this package.
