whaw - Window Tiling Tool

whaw is a mouse-driven program for X11 that uses advanced tiling algorithms and 
an intuitive user interface to quickly lay out windows without having to 
replace or modify the set up of your window manager of choice. whaw is meant to 
augment the capabilities of your current window manager, not supplant them.

When activated, you simply click on the windows you want to tile and they will 
be tiled either horizontally or vertically depending on what you chose.  In 
addition to tiling over the entire screen, you can choose to tile over a 
selected area, thus making whaw a very flexible program.

The program should be run in the background and should probably be started 
when your WM/DE is started.

Please see the man page for more details of program usage.
