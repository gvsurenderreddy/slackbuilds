WMMon monitors the your CPU, Disk I/O, Memory and Swap usage, and shows
an average load for CPU and Disk I/O. It also displays your uptime. You
just click on it to toggle the display.

This build includes security fixes and 2.6 kernel support added by Simon
Law (maintainer of the wmmon Debian package).
